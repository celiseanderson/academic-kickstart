# Final Thoughts
The final devlog of the term! Crazy to think about how far we've come. There are three presentations to get through for this week, so for this log I'll share my thoughts on each one individually. 

Social Media and Audience Research
- Interesting how the power of social media affects institutions as established as museums
- The page on Invitation Culture caught my attention
- Fascinating how this new medium is changing how museums interact with their audience
- Opportunity for a more personal interaction before they even arrive at the museum
- Would be interesting to see data on social media engagement correlating with museum attendance
- However, I could see the use of social media influencers being a double edged sword
- Lot of stigma surrounding influencers, might alienate an established audience
- However, also a lot of potential for reaching a new audience!
- The final slide also caught my attention in regards to the worry of museums becoming more about photography than education
- I feel like there is a middle ground here
- Some objects and exhibits shouldn't have photography (ie where material is damaged because of it)
- However, this isn't always the case
- Maybe museums can optimize some exhibits to be more photography friendly without risking security or damage
- Even just creating a few "photo friendly" areas, (big text, no glass cases, etc) could go a long way
- Something to keep in mind if designing exhibits


Web Archives
- This presentation introduced the concept of webarchives
- A snapshot of a webpage being stored as one file
- Can be accessed even after the webpage is gone
- Obvious limitations, but had a lot of potential
- As I wrote in hypothesis, I think we often take for granted that websites will be around forever
- We think this despite knowing that this is not true
- This can be a way to mitigate cultural and social losses from websites going down
- Also a way to study the evolution of the web
- Exact timestamps seem especially useful
- Will be exciting to see how this technnology evolves over time
- There are a few issues, such as privacy
- Very possible that the author of the page might not be aware that this is possible, and think what they deleted is no longer accessible
- Especially concerning in extreme cases (legal ramifications, copyright claims, revenge porn, etc)
- Still, I am optimistic these issues can be mitigated

Measuring Engagement and Analytics
- What drew me the most in this presentation was the idea of balance between the physical and online museums
- Obviously it is important to maintain the physical museum
- But, I think having an online presence is an increasingly important asset 
- I find it interesting in the card experiment that minimal difference was found between digital and physical
- The two should be able to complement each other to maximize engagement
- Obviously online can reach an audience that a physical museum can't
- However, physical museums can offer a more tangible experience in ways online can not
- But, online can offer more flexibility in presentation
- Also probably better suited for presenting media like video (how often I have walked into a video area of a museum only to leave immediately because they're halfway through the french video and I'm impatient)
- Personal anecdotes aside, each medium clearly has strengths and weaknesses
- However, I think those who manage to harness the digital side will see exponential potential for in person engagment as well

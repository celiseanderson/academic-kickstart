# Online Exhibits

Very busy week for me as interim letters were due and I had my presentation! 

In Class 
-  My presentation this week on Online Exhibits â€“ Cooked Data
- Went through all the articles listed here (https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/readings/#24-online-exhibits-cooked-data)
- Reading them, it became apparent that I wanted to show a bit about each one
- Each an example of very different types of online exhibits
- Wanted to show the range of what could be done
- I found it really inspiring to see what is possible currently and what could be possible in the future
- Also looked at the evolution of Google Arts and Culture 
- Really interesting site, addresses pros and cons of having exhibits through Google
- Example that intrigued me was the Ishtar Gate (https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/ishtar-gate-and-babylon-virtually-reunited-in-3d/swEODkwgvfZyEg)
- Very cool how they could create it in different contexts
- But, does it ignore greater problems? 
- Bandaid to much bigger problem of it being stolen and taken to Germany in the first place
- Does it being online really make it accessible? 
- So many rabbit holes to go down
- Idea of online exhibits assisting museums vs becoming its own thing

Project
- Went to the museum last week and took pictures of documents
- Also looked through the previous work done on the markers project
- Meeting with group, want to fill in to become a more complete data set
- Start thinking of what to do with it

# Group Project in Isolation

Apologies, I was sick this week and couldn’t attend class. As a result, I’m also super behind and overwhelmed with work so this may be on the shorter side. 

Project
- This week, thinking about what data is useful when building a data set
- Compatibility vs Concise
- Project only needs limited datafields for our purposes
- Should more datafields be kept to stay compatible with the previous work done?
- Importance of compatibility has repeatedly been brought up in the course
- BUT what good is the data if its incomprehensible
- Keeping extra fields leaves it more compatible for the museum maybe, but not for a wider audience
- What role is Heritage Jam in this? What kind of audience should this be for?
- On a side note, my mind keeps going towards how to build it as a relational database due to my other course
- Don’t want to overly complicate things

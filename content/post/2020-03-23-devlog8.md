# Group Project in Isolation

"In Class"
- This week reading and annotating Callum and Arianna's presentation on computational creativity
- Very topical!
- Generominos seems like a really cool idea, but the rules on the website definitely confused me
- Maybe a demonstration would make it more clear? (a la a practice round in a boardgame)
- Once again, the relationship between technology and humans brought into focus
- Computers can learn from humans creativity, but ultimately what it does is determined by humans
- AI example shows abuse of this (fake news)
- More reasons why AI is scary
- I think awareness in what AI can and cannot do is important

Project
- Honestly, feeling very overwhelmed due to factors outside of this course
- Obviously, covid 19 affecting many aspects of life
- What I have been looking at is the handwriting to text software
- Want to see if we can utilize it to help quickly find/fill in gaps in data set
- Problems of inheriting data made for another purpose by people we cannot contact... 
- Guess thats why devlogs are important!
- Had some trouble setting up (error messages, etc)
- Have an urgent assignment due tomorrow, so going to look into it more later in the week
- Not sure if this will be done in time for the api, but at least I'll have learned something

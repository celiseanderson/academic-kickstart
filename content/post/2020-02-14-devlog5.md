# Ownership and Authority and Preservation and Curation

This week trying out more informal devlogs, goal being to maximize impact on what I’m doing while minimizing work for me! We will see how this goes.

In Class
-This week, watched presentations on Ownership and Authority and Preservation and Curation
-To prepare, articles that caught my interest the most were CHIN Digital Preservation Case Study – 8th Hussars Museum ( https://www.canada.ca/en/heritage-information-network/services/digital-preservation/hussars-museum-study.html) and Sharing Authority: Creating Content and Experiences (
https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58fa685dff7c50f78be5f2b2/t/59dcdd27e5dd5b5a1b51d )
- CHIN article, looks at different methods of digital preservation 
-Future thinking, how to we keep up with technologies
-Also addressing the shortcomings/dangers of other technologies (ie cloud)
-Continually stress how important this is
-No point in digitizing things only to potentially lose them within 5 years (or less)
-Digitization requires constant upkeep
-Sharing Authority article a couple points caught my interest
-One, the #museumsrespondtoFerguson campaign to try and get museums to speak out on current events
-Addresses challenges in role of museum, to inform public? be objective? be involved? is silence worse?
-How are the roles of museums changing?
-Also describes pacific worlds exhibit
-Visitors responded well because it was on an underrepresented group of people
-Good example to reflect on the previous questions, all things to be conscious of
-In conclusion, making exhibits is hard work

Project
-Working to meet with everyone in our group
-Hopefully going to the museum during the break next week to look at materials
-Goal to get a better idea of what’s available to us now 
-Hopefully this will help me understand the direction of our project more

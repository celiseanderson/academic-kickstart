# Final Thoughts
The final devlog of the term! Crazy to think about how far we've come. There are three presentations to get through for this week, so for this log I'll share my thoughts on each one individually. 

Social Media and Audience Research
- Interesting how the power of social media affects institutions as established as museums
- The page on Invitation Culture caught my attention
- Fascinating how this new medium is changing how museums interact with their audience
- Opportunity for a more personal interaction before they even arrive at the museum
- Would be interesting to see data on social media engagement correlating with museum attendance
- However, I could see the use of social media influencers being a double edged sword
- Lot of stigma surrounding influencers, might alienate an established audience
- However, also a lot of potential for reaching a new audience!
- The final slide also caught my attention in regards to the worry of museums becoming more about photography than education
- I feel like there is a middle ground here
- Some objects and exhibits shouldn't have photography (ie where material is damaged because of it)
- However, this isn't always the case
- Maybe museums can optimize some exhibits to be more photography friendly without risking security or damage
- Even just creating a few "photo friendly" areas, (big text, no glass cases, etc) could go a long way
- Something to keep in mind if designing exhibits
